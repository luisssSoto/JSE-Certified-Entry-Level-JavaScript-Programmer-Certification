//Variables are like a box

//Naming Variables
// At the time that we name to variables these need to be named, depending of 
// the value inside of it and never named like a JS keyword

//Declaring Variables
// you need to declare them before to use them
//let or var nameOfVariable;
//It's highly recommend that use let than var

//var
var height;
var height;
console.log(height);

//let allow us to avoid redeclare variables twice or more than it
let height;
let height; // it has been declared yet before (uncomment to see error)
console.log(height);
